Feature: Creating a customerÂ´s account
  As a user I would like to record my data once so that I can use it again and again later.
  We expect at least the fields surname, first name, date of birth. Optionally there is also the address.
  If the person does not fill in a mandatory field, no new account with a customer number will be created and the person will receive one
  appropriate error message.
